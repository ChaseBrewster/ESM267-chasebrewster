The map displays survey data collected on Ofu-Olosega islands, American Samoa, during the summmer of 2019. 
The survey data was collected for the Coral Reef Advisory Group (CRAG) of American Samoa.
A valonia spp. algae outbreak first occured on the Ofu-Olosega islands in 2017.
The algae grows in dense patches, smothering corals and causing mortality of endemic and endangered coral species.
CRAG is working with the National Park Service, the American Samoa Department of Marine and Wildlife, and the USGS to manage the outbreak.
The survey data provides a baseline understanding of the extent and severity of the outbreak.

Included in the map are valonia spp. "hot spots", where algae cover was observed as greater than 50% within a 2m radius circle.
Also displayed are locations of experimental algae removal test plots, coastal springs (hypothesized to be nutrient loading), and locations of oceanographic monitoring equipment.
